## ⚖️ Academic Honesty

- Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation.
- AI can be a valuable tool for support, but it is not a substitute for your own work.
- If an assignment explicitly prohibits the use of AI, you are expected to comply fully with that instruction.
